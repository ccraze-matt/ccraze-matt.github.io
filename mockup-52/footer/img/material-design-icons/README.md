See also [Material Design Icons](https://materialdesignicons.com/), which is a collection combined from Google's Material Design Icons and community contributions. With the added benefit of being able to arbitrarily colorize the PNGs before download.

Also [Material Design Icons â€“ MaterialUp](http://www.materialup.com/tools/icons). I'm not sure whether or not that is the same collection.
